For one rope, you light up both ends, and simultaneously light up the other rope from one end.

Once the first rope burns out, 30 minutes must have passed.

Then whatever left on the second rope, is 30 minutes.

Therefore we can light up both ends of it, and once it finishes, it would be 15 minutes.

And this gives us 45 minutes.
