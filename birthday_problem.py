Let S be the set of possible birthday.

Initially, S = {Mar 4, Mar 5, Mar 8, Jun 4, Jun 7, Sep 1, Sep 5, Dec 1, Dec 2, Dec 8}

Now, the boss told you the month, and told the other colleague the day.

Let's consider the impact of the sentence you said "I dont know A's birthday; C doesn't know it either."
What does this mean? This means, you know the day must exist in two months, can't be unique.
Otherwise C would know A's birthday straightaway (for example, the day is 7th, then C would know its June)
So we can ignore Jun or Dec.

Therefore Month = Mar or Sep and the day should be {1, 4, 5, 8}.

C knows the answer straightaway after you said that, this means the birthday must be Sep 1.
Because 1 is not included in 5.
