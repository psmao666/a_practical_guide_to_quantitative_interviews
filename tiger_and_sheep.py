Let's consider a simpler case.

1. If there is only one tiger, then he can eat the sheep without consequences.

2. If there are two tigers, if one tiger eats the sheep, then it would become a sheep,
and this becomes case #1, which results in this tiger would be eaten, thus both tigers
would not eat the sheep.

3. If there are three tigers, if one tiger eats the sheep, then it would become a sheep,
and this becomes case #2, which results in this transformed sheep would not be eaten. Thus,
the sheep will be eaten in case there are three tigers.

4. If there are four tigers, if one tiger eats the sheep, then it would become case #3, and this 
sheep would be eaten, so the sheep wouldn't be eaten in case of 4 tigers.

...

If we continue this thinking, we would realise that 

if n is even, then the sheep wouldn't be eaten.
if n is odd, then the sheep would be eaten.
