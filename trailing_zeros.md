The number of trailing zeros is determined how many $2$ and $5$ there are in the factors of $100!$

$100!=1\times 2\times3\times\.\.\.\times 100$

There are more $2$ than $5$ obviously, so we just need to count the number of $5$.

There are $100/5=20$ 5s and we need to consider $25$ has 2 factors of 5 so the answer will be 24.
