A key fact is to realise A and B should go together but the lantern should not be passed back by either of them.

One more observation is, D should be the one running around to pass the lantern.

Therefore, we have a solution:
  
1. C and D walks to the otherside, takes 2 minutes
2. C comes back, takes 2 minutes (actually if D comes back it wouldn't affect the final answer)
3. A and B walks to the otherside, take 10 minutes
4. D comes back, take 1 minute
5. C and D walks to the otherside, take 2 minutes.

In total, it takes 10+2+2+2+1=17 minutes.
